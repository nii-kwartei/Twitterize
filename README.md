# Twitterize

MindReader: Twitterize
 * 
 * In Twitter, you are allowed only 140 characters to express your thoughts. To
 * be able to use these 140 characters as effectively as possible we derived the
 * following "compression" scheme, inspired by the words i18n and l10n:
 * 
 * from a given word take the first and the last letter, then count the number
 * of letter between the first and the last letter, finally, create a new string
 * consisting of the first letter, the number of characters in between and the
 * last letter.
 * 
 * For instance, the world "internationalization" thus becomes "i18n" and the
 * word "lano" becomes "l2o".
